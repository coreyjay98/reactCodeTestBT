## Project Description

Simple React project using basic HTML alongside the React and Babel libraries to allow the user to search for the top 10 Articles from the News API for whatever they input

### Installation

Due to complications with the News API the only current way to use the app is to clone the repo and run on your own machine

Simply clone the Repo and run the command `<npx serve>`, then go to whatever localhost port the serve package gives you and view the app there!

### Usage

I have included a short gif showing the usage of the app once it is on your localhost, also showcasing the mobile responsiveness in the CSS -
